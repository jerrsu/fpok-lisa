Unless PHPStorm is an official part of the project (e.g. it's mandated by a company, or agreed to by all team members) I would urge you to put its ignore settings into .git/info/exclude instead of .gitignore. The former is local to your copy, the latter should be committed and shared.

gitignore.io suggests this for Laravel:

# Created by https://www.gitignore.io/api/laravel

### Laravel ###

# Laravel 4 specific

# storage/*.key
